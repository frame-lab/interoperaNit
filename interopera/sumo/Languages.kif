population. 15,000,000 hard of hearing persons in the USA (1989 Sacks). 
Population total all countries 100,000 to 500,000. Region: Also used in

SIGN LANGUAGE, TACTILE SIGN LANGUAGE. Comments: Black American Sign Language 
developed in segregated schools in the south. It contains much sign 
vocabulary not in ASL and some different grammatical structure. Tactile 
Sign Language is used by over 900 persons in Louisiana who know ASL, but 
have lost their sight from a generic cause: Usher's Syndrome. They 
communicate by touch on each other's wrists. Some have migrated to Seattle. 
Some have learned Braille. ASL has 43% lexical similarity with French Sign 
Language in an 872-word list. Sign language interpreters provided in court, 
for college students, at important public events, in job training, at social 
services programs, in mental health service programs, some instruction for 
parents of deaf children, many sign language classes for hearing people.

learning ASL as second language. Reported to be the third largest language in 
the USA (1993 Honolulu Advertiser). Used since 1817. ASL is different from 
'English on the Hands' (Signed English, Siglish). There are several systems 
of manually coded English, including different ones in different countries.

taught in schools in the USA rather than ASL. Investigation needed:

desire for standardization among educators. There are rumors of relationships 
to sign languages from Germany, Ireland, Australia, England, South Africa. 
Deaf people go to different schools, each using a different sign language. 
There have been elementary schools for deaf children since the 1940s. The 
Ministry of Education has pushed to open more spaces for deaf students in 
special classes in local schools. There is little research on the sign 
language. The deaf community is quite strong in terms of individual identity. 
They live their lives around deaf social networks and activities. There is a 
manual alphabet used for spelling English, possibly related to that in South 
Africa. Literacy in English is better among some deaf people than others, but 
generally limited. It is quite limited in Shona, mainly known by those from 
Masvingo. TV.(extract from http://www.ethnologue.com/)")

are 3 second-language varieties spoken by different people: (1) fluent Tetum

with significant influence from their own local mother tongues, and (3) 
people originally from Timor Lorosae who are overseas residents in Portugal or 
Australia, with higher portion of inflected Portuguese vocabulary and almost 
complete lack of Indonesian or Malay loans. There is also 'Tetum Ibadat' or 
'liturgical Tetum' which is not spoken by anyone for everyday communication, 
nor as mother tongue, with a lot of vocabulary and some grammar that is not 
understood widely. Cultural rituals and themes in Tetun are not as deeply 
rooted in Tetum Prasa. Heavy Portuguese and Mambae influence. Language of 
wider communication. Compared to Tetun: many more Portuguese loan words, does 
not inflect V-initial verb roots for person or number, uses more 
periphrastic constructions than morphological constructions (e.g., 
causatives), differences in possessive constructions and negatives.

so it is not possible at this time (1995) to say how different any of the

communication 1995). Some speakers speak Standard Slovene well, some use it 
only in church. Some of the ethnic group are able to speak the dialects, some 
are losing their command of them. Many speakers go to church, where they hear 
Standard Slovene. Speakers are bilingual or trilingual in the Slovenian 
dialect (Windisch), a German regional variety (Karntnerisch or Steierisch), or 
Standard German. Most speakers educated since 1945 speak Standard German
